### Inventory
- "Simple, intuitive UI"
- "Real-time stock tracking"
- "Low stock alerts"
- "Quick actions for efficiency"

### Orders
- "Event-driven workflow"
- "Automatic stock reservation"
- "Auto-invoice generation"
- "Consistent data across services"

### Analytics
- "Real-time updates every 10 seconds"
- "Business intelligence dashboards"
- "Zero data loss"

## Backup Plans

### Plan A: Services Down
Navigate to `demo/screenshots/` and walk through images

### Plan B: Frontend Slow
Run E2E test in headed mode:
```bash
cd e2e
npm run test:headed
```

### Plan C: Total Failure
Show API responses directly:
```bash
# Products
curl http://localhost:8002/products | jq

# Create order
curl -X POST http://localhost:8001/orders \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"customer_id":"API","items":[{"sku":"CAM-1001","qty":2,"price":299.99}]}' | jq

# Analytics
curl http://localhost:8004/sales/hourly?hours=1 | jq
```

## Common Questions (Quick Answers)

**Q: Event streaming?**
"NATS JetStream. Order placed â†’ inventory reserves stock â†’ billing creates invoice. Decoupled, durable, fast."

**Q: Why DuckDB?**
"OLAP-optimized. Billions of rows in milliseconds. PostgreSQL for OLTP, DuckDB for analytics."

**Q: Failure handling?**
"Health checks, message durability, idempotent operations, Docker restart policies."

**Q: Scalability?**
"Docker Compose now, Kubernetes next. NATS and DuckDB scale horizontally. Architected for growth."

**Q: Security?**
"Demo has none. Production adds Keycloak (OAuth2), rate limiting, TLS, Vault, RBAC."

**Q: Build time?**
"2 weeks from scratch. Event-driven architecture took design time, but worth it."

## Recovery Commands

### Restart Everything
```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.base.yml \
  -f docker-compose.services.yml \
  -f docker-compose.bi.yml \
  -f docker-compose.erp.yml \
  restart
```

### Reset Data
```bash
docker-compose down -v
docker-compose up -d
./scripts/migrate.sh
./scripts/seed_demo.sh
```

### Check Service Health
```bash
for port in 8001 8002 8003 8004 3001; do
  echo -n "Port $port: "
  curl -s http://localhost:$port/health && echo "âœ“" || echo "âœ—"
done
```
